# Cybersecurity Principles

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:
- Define cybersecurity and its importance
- Identify key cybersecurity principles
- Explain the role of cybersecurity in modern organizations

## Concept Overview

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes.

### Key Principles

The fundamental principles of cybersecurity include:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of assets.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

## Real-World Examples

- Equifax data breach (2017) - A failure in implementing security patches led to the exposure of personal information of 143 million Americans.
- Target breach (2013) - Hackers gained access through a third-party vendor, affecting 40 million credit and debit cards.

## Tools Used

- Risk assessment frameworks
- Security policies and procedures
- Access control mechanisms

## Hands-On Lab

### Purpose
Understand how to identify and classify sensitive data in an organization.

### Prerequisites
- Computer with internet access
- Text editor

### Tools Required
- Text editor
- Sample company data classification policy

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Open your text editor
2. Create a simple data classification scheme with the following categories:
   - Public
   - Internal
   - Confidential
   - Restricted
3. Identify 5 types of data that would fit in each category for a typical company
4. Document your findings

### Expected Output
You should have a simple data classification scheme with examples for each category.

### Troubleshooting
- If you get stuck, review the basic cybersecurity principles again.
- Consider different types of data an organization might handle.

### Safety Notes
- All exercises are performed on local machines - no real systems are affected
- This exercise is for educational purposes only

## Checklist / Summary

- Cybersecurity is essential for protecting digital assets
- The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) forms the foundation of cybersecurity
- Regular risk assessments help maintain security

## Review Questions

1. What are the three components of the CIA triad?
2. Why is cybersecurity important for organizations?
3. Describe one real-world example of a significant cybersecurity failure and its impact.
